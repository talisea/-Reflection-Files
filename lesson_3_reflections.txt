When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

	working on the repo from different devices
	working on the repo in collaboration with other people
	want to share the project with the open source community

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Manual pulls give you full control over when and how changes
	are integrated into the local repository. This means, changes
	can be reviewed, conflicts can be resolved and we can gain a
	better understanding for the impact of each change before it
	affects out work.

	Manual pulls facilitate cleaner commit histories through
	rebasing. This prevents disruptions from unexpected updates,
	especially on sensitive branches. We can manage uncommitted
	changes before integration. 

	Ultimately, manual pulls enhance control and maintain a
	more organized Git repository.
