What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	git init creates a new repository. The new hidden directory .git will
	store the history of the files that are tracked in this repository.

	It's needed to either start a new project with version controll or
	to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is like a temporal directory to store the files with
	the made changes for the next commit. The working directory and the
	repository may have more files than the ones waiting for their submit
	in the staging area.

	It offers the value to controll which files are included into a commit,
	what makes it easier to ensure 1 commit per logical change.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	Before adding files to the staging area, I can compare the made changes
	in my working directory to the staging area by using 
			git diff
	After adding the changed files to the staging area, I can doublecheck if
	everything is like it should by using
			git diff --staged
	to compare the staging area to the most recent commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	branches can be usefull to experiment with additional ideas in a project
	or organise f.e. different language files while creating translated
	versions of a project.
	that way the main project stays clean while we can explore our experiments
	or translations or whatever we wanted to do in the project and created the
	branch for.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	they give an easy to understand overview regarding the branch structure,
	history and merges.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

	Merging two branches combines the changes that have been made and
	creates a new commit at the tip of the currently checked out branch.
	Therefor the currently checked out branch should be one of the branches
	you want to merge.

	The way it is shown in the diagram visualizes combining of one
	branch into another in a clear and easy to understand way.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

	automatic merging saves a lot of time, because it combines the files
	based on simple and fix rules. Therefor the more timeconsuming comparing
	of files is only needed, when git runs into merging conflicts.
	e.g. different changes in the same basic area.

	Merge Conflicts canÂ´t be solved by git. Even if someone would train
	an AI to solve merge conflicts, it would remain a guessing game and
	often result in code that may not pass the compiler or in a crashing
	programm
